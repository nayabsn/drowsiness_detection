## Driver Drowsiness Detection - Using Visual, Physiological & Vehicle-Based Methods

This repo will contain the scripts to detect drowsiness on a RP4. This will be done by checking for visual cues of drowsiness (eye closure and yawning), physiological cues (BPM/heart rate) and vehicle-based cues (grip detection on the steering wheel) using Raspberry Pi.
